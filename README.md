# Diamond Price Prediction

## Description
This project develops a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on attributes like carat, cut, color, and clarity, using detailed data analysis and advanced predictive techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:
- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: Diamond color, from D (best) to J (worst).
- **Clarity**: Clarity grade (IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1).
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to its widest point.
- **Price**: Price of the diamond.
- **X, Y, Z**: Dimensions of the diamond in mm.
 

## Results
The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. Detailed results can be found in the `main.ipynb` notebook.
